.*      .add(E object)                           adds an new object in the collection

        .addAll(collection<E> c)                 all a collection of objects in the collection and usely at the end 
        
        .remove(object   )                       this method will remove and object from the collection
        
        .removeAll(collection<E> c)              this will remove a collection of objects from our collection
        
        retainAll(collection<E> c)              this is just like the compliment of previous one this will delete all the objects
                                                 .from this collectiion except which are present in collection C
                                                 
        .clear()                                 this well clear the collection 
        
        .isEmpty()                               this will return true if the collections doesn't have any object
        
        .contains()                              this will check for and object is present in the collection or not
        
        .equals(object)                          this will check if all the objects of two collection is equal or not
        
        .size()                                  this we return the size of the collection
        
        itertor()                               this will help us to iterate over the collection , means accesssing the element one by one

        .toArray()                               this will convert a collection into an array
